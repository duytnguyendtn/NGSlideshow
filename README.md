# `fbclock` Attribution
The Frame Buffer clock program was ported from [Hermann-SW](https://github.com/Hermann-SW)'s effort to make fbclock.c compatible on raspbian in the [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/Hermann-SW/src). The file was taken from commit [83d18e](https://github.com/Hermann-SW/src/blob/83d18e3e334e364ab68d3f24c7d75ea3038646d1/bin/fbclock.c).
